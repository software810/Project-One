**Build a Java Snake Game**

Snake is an older classic video game. It was first created in late 70s. Later it was brought to PCs. In this game the player controls a snake. The objective is to eat as many apples as possible. Each time the snake eats an apple its body grows. The snake must avoid the walls and its own body.

Snake is also an ideal game to create 2D games in Java. The snake is controlled with the cursor keys. Initially, the snake has three joints. If the game is finished, the "Game Over" message is displayed in the middle of the board.
